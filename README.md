# Moatless Tools
*We Have No Moat, And Neither Does Devin*

The philosophy behind Moatless Tools is that at the current level of LLMs, reasoning is not the most important aspect, 
but rather providing the LLM with the correct context in prompts and handling responses in an appropriate manner. 
This can be resolved by focusing on building good tooling that an agent can use.

Moatless Tools a collection of tools AI agents can use to find and update code, until AGI takes over. 

Check [this Jupyter notebook](notebooks/swebench.ipynb) to see how to use these tools.
