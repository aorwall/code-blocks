Design a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache that removes the least recently used item when reaching its maximum capacity. Your cache should support the following functionalities:

* Insert a key-value pair into the cache. If the key is already present, update the existing value. If the cache has reached its capacity, evict the least recently used item before inserting the new key-value pair.
* Retrieve the value associated with the specified key from the cache. Return a null-equivalent value if the key is not found.

The LRU Cache should have a predetermined, fixed size, specified during its instantiation.

Constraints:
* Assume that both keys and values are non-negative integers.
* Refrain from using specialized data structures or libraries made specifically for LRU Cache implementations.
* Basic data structures like arrays, hash tables, and tuples are permissible.
