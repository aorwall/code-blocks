"""Input validation for standard estimators.

    Checks X and y for consistent length, enforces X 2d and y 1d.
    Standard input checks are only applied to y, such as checking that y
    does not have np.nan or np.inf targets. For multi-label y, set
    multi_output=True to allow 2d and sparse y.  If the dtype of X is
    object, attempt converting to float, raising on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : nd-array, list or sparse matrix
        Input data.

    y : nd-array, list or sparse matrix
        Labels.

    accept_sparse : string, boolean or list of string (default=False)
        String[s] representing allowed sparse matrix formats, such as 'csc',
        'csr', etc. If the input is sparse but not in the allowed format,
        it will be converted to the first listed format. True allows the input
        to be any format. False means that a sparse matrix input will
        raise an error.

        .. deprecated:: 0.19
           Passing 'None' to parameter ``accept_sparse`` in methods is
           deprecated in version 0.19 "and will be removed in 0.21. Use
           ``accept_sparse=False`` instead.

    dtype : string, type, list of types or None (default="numeric")
        Data type of result. If None, the dtype of the input is preserved.
        If "numeric", dtype is preserved unless array.dtype is object.
        If dtype is a list of types, conversion on the first type is only
        performed if the dtype of the input is not in the list.

    order : 'F', 'C' or None (default=None)
        Whether an array will be forced to be fortran or c-style.

    copy : boolean (default=False)
        Whether a forced copy will be triggered. If copy=False, a copy might
        be triggered by a conversion.

    force_all_finite : boolean or 'allow-nan', (default=True)
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf and np.nan in X. This parameter
        does not influence whether y can have np.inf or np.nan values.
        The possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of X to be finite.
        - False: accept both np.inf and np.nan in X.
        - 'allow-nan':  accept  only  np.nan  values in  X.  Values  cannot  be
          infinite.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``force_all_finite`` accepts the string ``'allow-nan'``.

    ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
        Whether to make X at least 2d.

    allow_nd : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow X.ndim > 2.

    multi_output : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow 2-d y (array or sparse matrix). If false, y will be
        validated as a vector. y cannot have np.nan or np.inf values if
        multi_output=True.

    ensure_min_samples : int (default=1)
        Make sure that X has a minimum number of samples in its first
        axis (rows for a 2D array).

    ensure_min_features : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the 2D array has some minimum number of features
        (columns). The default value of 1 rejects empty datasets.
        This check is only enforced when X has effectively 2 dimensions or
        is originally 1D and ``ensure_2d`` is True. Setting to 0 disables
        this check.

    y_numeric : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to ensure that y has a numeric type. If dtype of y is object,
        it is converted to float64. Should only be used for regression
        algorithms.

    warn_on_dtype : boolean (default=False)
        Raise DataConversionWarning if the dtype of the input data structure
        does not match the requested dtype, causing a memory copy.

    estimator : str or estimator instance (default=None)
        If passed, include the name of the estimator in warning messages.

    Returns
    -------
    X_converted : object
        The converted and validated X.

    y_converted : object
        The converted and validated y.

class GradientBoostingClassifier(BaseGradientBoosting, ClassifierMixin):
    """Gradient Boosting for classification.

    GB builds an additive model in a
    forward stage-wise fashion; it allows for the optimization of
    arbitrary differentiable loss functions. In each stage ``n_classes_``
    regression trees are fit on the negative gradient of the
    binomial or multinomial deviance loss function. Binary classification
    is a special case where only a single regression tree is induced.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : {'deviance', 'exponential'}, optional (default='deviance')
        loss function to be optimized. 'deviance' refers to
        deviance (= logistic regression) for classification
        with probabilistic outputs. For loss 'exponential' gradient
        boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.

    learning_rate : float, optional (default=0.1)
        learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.
        There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.

    n_estimators : int (default=100)
        The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting
        is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually
        results in better performance.

    subsample : float, optional (default=1.0)
        The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base
        learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient
        Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.
        Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance
        and an increase in bias.

    criterion : string, optional (default="friedman_mse")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "friedman_mse" for the mean squared error with improvement
        score by Friedman, "mse" for mean squared error, and "mae" for
        the mean absolute error. The default value of "friedman_mse" is
        generally the best as it can provide a better approximation in
        some cases.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_depth : integer, optional (default=3)
        maximum depth of the individual regression estimators. The maximum
        depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter
        for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction
        of the input variables.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, optional (default=0.)
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7)
        Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
        if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

        .. deprecated:: 0.19
           ``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of
           ``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of
           ``min_impurity_split`` will change from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it
           will be removed in 0.25. Use ``min_impurity_decrease`` instead.

    init : estimator or 'zero', optional (default=None)
        An estimator object that is used to compute the initial predictions.
        ``init`` has to provide `fit` and `predict_proba`. If 'zero', the
        initial raw predictions are set to zero. By default, a
        ``DummyEstimator`` predicting the classes priors is used.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Choosing `max_features < n_features` leads to a reduction of variance
        and an increase in bias.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    verbose : int, default: 0
        Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints progress and performance
        once in a while (the more trees the lower the frequency). If greater
        than 1 then it prints progress and performance for every tree.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    warm_start : bool, default: False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just erase the
        previous solution. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    presort : bool or 'auto', optional (default='auto')
        Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
        fitting. Auto mode by default will use presorting on dense data and
        default to normal sorting on sparse data. Setting presort to true on
        sparse data will raise an error.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *presort* parameter.

    validation_fraction : float, optional, default 0.1
        The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
        early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
        Only used if ``n_iter_no_change`` is set to an integer.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    n_iter_no_change : int, default None
        ``n_iter_no_change`` is used to decide if early stopping will be used
        to terminate training when validation score is not improving. By
        default it is set to None to disable early stopping. If set to a
        number, it will set aside ``validation_fraction`` size of the training
        data as validation and terminate training when validation score is not
        improving in all of the previous ``n_iter_no_change`` numbers of
        iterations. The split is stratified.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    tol : float, optional, default 1e-4
        Tolerance for the early stopping. When the loss is not improving
        by at least tol for ``n_iter_no_change`` iterations (if set to a
        number), the training stops.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_estimators_ : int
        The number of estimators as selected by early stopping (if
        ``n_iter_no_change`` is specified). Otherwise it is set to
        ``n_estimators``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    feature_importances_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).

    oob_improvement_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
        The improvement in loss (= deviance) on the out-of-bag samples
        relative to the previous iteration.
        ``oob_improvement_[0]`` is the improvement in
        loss of the first stage over the ``init`` estimator.

    train_score_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
        The i-th score ``train_score_[i]`` is the deviance (= loss) of the
        model at iteration ``i`` on the in-bag sample.
        If ``subsample == 1`` this is the deviance on the training data.

    loss_ : LossFunction
        The concrete ``LossFunction`` object.

    init_ : estimator
        The estimator that provides the initial predictions.
        Set via the ``init`` argument or ``loss.init_estimator``.

        used, predicting either the average target value (for loss='ls'), or
        a quantile for the other losses.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Choosing `max_features < n_features` leads to a reduction of variance
        and an increase in bias.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    alpha : float (default=0.9)
        The alpha-quantile of the huber loss function and the quantile
        loss function. Only if ``loss='huber'`` or ``loss='quantile'``.

    verbose : int, default: 0
        Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints progress and performance
        once in a while (the more trees the lower the frequency). If greater
        than 1 then it prints progress and performance for every tree.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    warm_start : bool, default: False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just erase the
        previous solution. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    presort : bool or 'auto', optional (default='auto')
        Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
        fitting. Auto mode by default will use presorting on dense data and
        default to normal sorting on sparse data. Setting presort to true on
        sparse data will raise an error.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           optional parameter *presort*.

    validation_fraction : float, optional, default 0.1
        The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
        early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
        Only used if ``n_iter_no_change`` is set to an integer.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    n_iter_no_change : int, default None
        ``n_iter_no_change`` is used to decide if early stopping will be used
        to terminate training when validation score is not improving. By
        default it is set to None to disable early stopping. If set to a
        number, it will set aside ``validation_fraction`` size of the training
        data as validation and terminate training when validation score is not
        improving in all of the previous ``n_iter_no_change`` numbers of
        iterations.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    tol : float, optional, default 1e-4
        Tolerance for the early stopping. When the loss is not improving
        by at least tol for ``n_iter_no_change`` iterations (if set to a
        number), the training stops.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20


    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).

    oob_improvement_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
        The improvement in loss (= deviance) on the out-of-bag samples
        relative to the previous iteration.
        ``oob_improvement_[0]`` is the improvement in
        loss of the first stage over the ``init`` estimator.

    train_score_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
        The i-th score ``train_score_[i]`` is the deviance (= loss) of the
        model at iteration ``i`` on the in-bag sample.
        If ``subsample == 1`` this is the deviance on the training data.

    loss_ : LossFunction
        The concrete ``LossFunction`` object.

    init_ : estimator
        The estimator that provides the initial predictions.
        Set via the ``init`` argument or ``loss.init_estimator``.

    estimators_ : array of DecisionTreeRegressor, shape (n_estimators, 1)
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    Notes
    -----
    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and
    ``max_features=n_features``, if the improvement of the criterion is
    identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best
    split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting,
    ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

"""An AdaBoost regressor.

    An AdaBoost [1] regressor is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a
    regressor on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the
    regressor on the same dataset but where the weights of instances are
    adjusted according to the error of the current prediction. As such,
    subsequent regressors focus more on difficult cases.

    This class implements the algorithm known as AdaBoost.R2 [2].

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <adaboost>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_estimator : object, optional (default=None)
        The base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is built.

        the base estimator is ``DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)``

    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=50)
        The maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated.

    loss : {'linear', 'square', 'exponential'}, optional (default='linear')
        The loss function to use when updating the weights after each
        boosting iteration.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of classifiers
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimator_weights_ : array of floats
        Weights for each estimator in the boosted ensemble.
