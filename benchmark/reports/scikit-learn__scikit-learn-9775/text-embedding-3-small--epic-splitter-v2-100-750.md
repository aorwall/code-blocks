def trustworthiness(X, X_embedded, n_neighbors=5, precomputed=False):
    r"""Expresses to what extent the local structure is retained.

    The trustworthiness is within [0, 1]. It is defined as

    .. math::

        T(k) = 1 - \frac{2}{nk (2n - 3k - 1)} \sum^n_{i=1}
            \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_{i}^{k}} \max(0, (r(i, j) - k))

    where for each sample i, :math:`\mathcal{N}_{i}^{k}` are its k nearest
    neighbors in the output space, and every sample j is its :math:`r(i, j)`-th
    nearest neighbor in the input space. In other words, any unexpected nearest
    neighbors in the output space are penalised in proportion to their rank in
    the input space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array, shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)
        If the metric is 'precomputed' X must be a square distance
        matrix. Otherwise it contains a sample per row.

    X_embedded : array, shape (n_samples, n_components)
        Embedding of the training data in low-dimensional space.

    n_neighbors : int, optional (default: 5)
        Number of neighbors k that will be considered.

    precomputed : bool, optional (default: False)
        Set this flag if X is a precomputed square distance matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    trustworthiness : float
        Trustworthiness of the low-dimensional embedding.
